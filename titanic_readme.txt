Titanic Survivors

You are working on the Titanic Survivors data set,
which includes information on the passengers of the ship.
The data is stored in a CSV file named titanic.csv
file available at <https://github.com/fauziardha1/sololearn-machine-learning/blob/master/titanic.csv>,
You want to understand how the class of the ticket impacted the survival rate.
For that,
you need to find and output the mean class value for the passengers who are adults (Age >= 18),
grouped by the Survived column.
